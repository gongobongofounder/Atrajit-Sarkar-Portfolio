**About Me**

**Mathematical Background**
I am Atrajit, a passionate mathematician and software developer, having completed my **MSc in Mathematics from IIT Delhi**. My primary academic interests lie in **analysis, number theory, and algebra**, and I am actively preparing for **PhD admissions in August 2025**.

I have completed a project on Morse theory under the supervision of Dr. Biplab Basak. You can find my project in first blog.


**Technical and Coding Background**
Beyond my mathematical pursuits, I have a deep passion for programming and technology. I specialize in **Jetpack Compose for Android development**, with hands-on experience in **chat applications, GitHub-integrated content fetching, and local database management using Hilt**. Additionally, I have a strong command over **C++**, where I teach students and explore areas like **3D simulation**. My programming expertise also extends to **Python automation**, with projects including **WhatsApp auto-replies, PDF conversions, and file handling**.

**Teaching Background**
- I am actively engaged in **mentoring students** in mobile app development, guiding them through beginner and intermediate-level projects. I also have experience in **networking applications**, particularly in establishing **internet-based communication between app instances**.

- I taught BSC students and Msc students recently the following topics in Mathematics:
1. Real Analysis
2. Modern Algebra
3. Linear Algebra
4. Topology
5. Functional Analysis
6. Measure Theory
7. Algebraic Topology
and many more...(I can't remeber or maybe I did not teach other topics that much.)

**Literature Background**
I have been once very enthusiast about Literature and poems and stories and I read and wrote a couple of them in bengali and english. A book <a href="https://amzn.in/d/6zU2fgt"> "Silhouette Of Words" </a> is on Amazon for sale.


**Phylosophy About Life and Goals**
With a forward-thinking mindset, I strive to bridge the gap between **mathematical theory and real-world applications** through innovative software solutions. My goal is to contribute to academia and industry by leveraging my expertise in **mathematics and software engineering**.

I keep learning newskills and also forgetting old ones. Never mind. The much I can learn from this world is my goal and I love it.
