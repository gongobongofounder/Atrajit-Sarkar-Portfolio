    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <h3>Mathematical Background</h3>
    <p>I am Atrajit, a passionate mathematician and software developer, having completed my <strong>MSc in Mathematics from IIT Delhi</strong>. My primary academic interests lie in <strong>analysis, number theory, and algebra</strong>, and I am actively preparing for <strong>PhD admissions in August 2025</strong>.</p>
    <p>I have completed a project on Morse theory under the supervision of Dr. Biplab Basak. You can find my project in first blog.</p>

    <h3>Technical and Coding Background</h3>
    <p>Beyond my mathematical pursuits, I have a deep passion for programming and technology. I specialize in <strong>Jetpack Compose for Android development</strong>, with hands-on experience in <strong>chat applications, GitHub-integrated content fetching, and local database management using Hilt</strong>. Additionally, I have a strong command over <strong>C++</strong>, where I teach students and explore areas like <strong>3D simulation</strong>. My programming expertise also extends to <strong>Python automation</strong>, with projects including <strong>WhatsApp auto-replies, PDF conversions, and file handling</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Teaching Background</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I am actively engaged in <strong>mentoring students</strong> in mobile app development, guiding them through beginner and intermediate-level projects. I also have experience in <strong>networking applications</strong>, particularly in establishing <strong>internet-based communication between app instances</strong>.</li>
        <li>I taught BSc and MSc students the following topics in Mathematics:
            <ul>
                <li>Real Analysis</li>
                <li>Modern Algebra</li>
                <li>Linear Algebra</li>
                <li>Topology</li>
                <li>Functional Analysis</li>
                <li>Measure Theory</li>
                <li>Algebraic Topology</li>
                <li>...and more</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Literature Background</h3>
    <p>I have been once very enthusiastic about literature, poems, and stories, and I have read and written a couple of them in Bengali and English. A book <a href="https://amzn.in/d/6zU2fgt">"Silhouette Of Words"</a> is on Amazon for sale.</p>

    <h3>Philosophy About Life and Goals</h3>
    <p>With a forward-thinking mindset, I strive to bridge the gap between <strong>mathematical theory and real-world applications</strong> through innovative software solutions. My goal is to contribute to academia and industry by leveraging my expertise in <strong>mathematics and software engineering</strong>.</p>
    <p>I keep learning new skills and also forgetting old ones. Never mind. The much I can learn from this world is my goal, and I love it.</p>
